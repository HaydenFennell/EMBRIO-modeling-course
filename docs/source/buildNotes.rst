Notes on Current Build (0.2)
============================

This site is currently a prototype, intended primarily to test functionality of the content delivery platform. We will begin populating module content soon. Please send any and all feedback to Hayden Fennell at hfennel **at** iu **dot** edu.

Known Issues
------------

* There are some issues with sidebar navigation on certain pages. This is due to some pages not being updated as we make rapid changes to content. A full source file rebuild will be performed (which will fix sidebar navigation) in the next build upload.
* There are some missing images on a couple of the notebooks. These should be marked. These are images that were lost in the original notebooks. We are currently looking for replacements to fix the broken links.
* The notebook/resource appendix is still under construction as content shifts. Please check back again for regular updates.

Content Update Schedule
-----------------------

This site will follow a weekly update schedule. Updates will be pushed and the build number will be updated each Friday afternoon. Please see the table below for the current content update schedule:
