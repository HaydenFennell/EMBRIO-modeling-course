Introduction
============

This section will walk you through the basic information that you will need to orient yourself for completing the rest of the course.

What is Modeling?
-----------------

Good question. Here's the Wikipedia page on modeling: `computational model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_model>`_.
(This was a link test; more bespoke content coming soon.)

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Biological modeling is a complicated topic, combining knowledge and expertise from a number of different fields. This course is designed to teach you the basics from each field that you will need to know to get started in building your own biological simulations. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

#. Create abstract representations of complex biological systems 
#. Read and interpret basic Python code used in scientific simulations.
#. Create Python functions to perform tasks necessary to your system
#. Navigate the basics of multiscale modeling, including:
   
   #. Creating simulations of multicellular phenomenon
   #. Implementing subcellular chemical signalling network models into a multicellular model
   #. Representing the behavior of chemical diffusion and stochastic nutrient delivery in the extracellular matrix.
   
#. [additional objectives in progress].
