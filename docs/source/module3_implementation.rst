Module 3: Implementing Simulations
==================================

In the previous module, we discussed how to take our conceptual models and use them to create mathematical representations of the system. The next step in using our models is to import them into a framework that allows us to study them with simulations. Often, the terms "model and "simulation" are used somewhat interchangeably in discussion of computational methods. However, it is important to distinguish between the two, as there are important differences. Everything that we have discussed up to this point has been with regard to the creation of biological models. As discussed in Module 1, a model is a representation of a real-world system which captures how certain inputs affect/produce specific outputs. This module will show how to build computer simulations out of your models.

A simulation, then, is a construct that allows you to run a model with given inputs in order to make predictions about the expected output(s). A simulation implements a model, allowing the model to generate data and/or other information about the system under study.

For the purposes of this module, all of our simulations will be implemented directly in Python code. We will discuss some other more complex and more purpose-built simulation frameworks in later modules.

As we discussed in Module 1, the most common method of running a simulation is through iterative code, or the loops of a program as introduced in Section 0.3. By translating our equations into computer code and nesting them into an algorithm that represents the model, we can "run" the model by iteratively executing the code. In almost all cases, the variable being "iterated over" is time, as most of our scientific questions will be centered around how a system behaves over time.
