Appendix #: Catalog of Jupyter Notebooks
========================================

This page catalogs all of the existing interactive Jupyter notebook content currently offered by the EMBRIO institute. See the descriptions in each section for more information.

Instructional Modules
---------------------

These notebooks are full educational modules for learning the basics of computational biology.

How to Use Jupyter Notebooks (in Google Colab)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
This notebook will walk you through the basics of using interactive Jupyter notebooks within the Google Collaboratory environment. If you are not experienced in using Jupyter or other coding notebook interfaces, it is **highly** recommended that you walk through this notebook before doing anything else. Google Chrome is recommended for best performance.

Projects
--------

These notebooks are sample projects presented as Colab notebooks. Work through these to test your skills!

Reaction and Diffusion in an Antibody Detection Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**

You have been commissioned by a biotech company to define the operating procedures for their serological test. Specifically, you need to develop a computational model of their detector and use this model to determine: (1) What is the limit of detection of their device (i.e., what is the lowest concentration of patient antibody that this device can detect) and (2) How long after loading a sample should you wait before reading the result? The tasks in this project walk you through the steps toward answering these questions.

**Learning Objectives:**

**Recommended Prerequisites:**

* How to Use Jupyter Notebooks 
* Introduction to Scientific Computing

Example Papers
--------------

These notebooks summarize published papers that utilize computational methods to address biological problems and questions. Models from the papers have been converted to interactive Python code for many of these papers.

Morphogen Gradients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**

Morphogen gradients have been observed in tissue and are believed to be the driving force behind patterns of cells and tissues. Generaly these morphogens are produced from a localized source and are moved around to form a gradient among surrounding tissues, however the mechanism behind the formation of these stable gradients is something of a controversey.
